##A Beginner’s Guide to Creating a README

If you are just starting out with open source one of the most important things to include is good documentation. This starts with a solid README file. At its core a README should include:

1. **What does your project do?** Share the vision of the need that your project is trying to meet.
2. **How is it set up?** If someone were to pick up your codebase today how would they get everything running in their local environment.
3. **How is it used?** Once it’s up and running provide some very descriptive examples of usage.
4. **Is it in good shape?** Do you have code climate, codeship, or other tools running to indicate the health of the project? Include information on dependencies as well.
5. **How can others help?** Collaboration yields amazing software. Make it easy for others to get involved by letting them know how to submit new features, report issues, or offer other assistance.
6. **License information** Don’t forget to let others know what license your project is released under. Not sure? [Oreilly has an open book on understanding licensing](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/osfreesoft/book/index.html).

You can extend this to include credits and acknowledgement, changelog details, and more but this will provide a solid foundation.
