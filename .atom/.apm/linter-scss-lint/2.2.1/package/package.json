It will be used with files that have the “SCSS” syntax.\n\n### Installation\nLinter package will automatically be installed for you if you do not already have it.\n\n#### scss-lint installation\nBefore using this plugin, you must ensure that `scss-lint` is installed on your system. To install `scss-lint`, do the following:\n\n1. Install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).\n\n2. Install [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) by typing the following in a terminal:\n   ```\n   gem install scss_lint\n   ```\n\nNow you can proceed to install the linter-scss-lint plugin.\n\n#### Plugin installation\n```\n$ apm install linter-scss-lint\n```\n\n### Settings\nYou can configure linter-scss-lint by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):\n```cson\n'linter-scss-lint':\n\n  # Optionally specify additional arguments to be passed to `scss-lint`.\n  # Run `scss-lint -h` to see available options.\n  'additionalArguments': null\n\n  # The `scss-lint` path. Run `which scss-lint` to find this path.\n  'executablePath': null\n```\n\n### Config file\nLinter will start looking for `.scss-lint.yml` file in the same directory as the file that's being linted. If not found, it will move one level up the directory tree all the way up to the filesystem root.\n\n\n### Contributing\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1.
