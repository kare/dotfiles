# Kare's Dotfiles
My personal collection of dotfiles including Plan9port, Acme (where's that config?), plumber, Zsh, Bash and Vim.

## Install

Dotfiles comes with a simple installation script ```setup-dotfiles```. Make sure your run it in an empty $HOME directory. It uses ```mv -i``` for safely moving the dotfiles to your $HOME directory. Mv cannot overwrite existing folders (like bin or lib).
```sh
cd
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kare/dotfiles/master/bin/setup-dotfiles > setup-dotfiles
chmod 755 setup-dotfiles
./setup-dotfiles
rm setup-dotfiles
```
