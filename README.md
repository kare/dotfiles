# Kare's Dotfiles
My personal collection of dotfiles including Plan9port, Acme (where's that
config?), plumber, Zsh, Bash and Vim.

## Install

Start intallation by testing ssh connection to GitHub. Make sure your ssh key is
correctly installed.
Dotfiles comes with a simple installation script ```setup-dotfiles```. Make sure
your run it in an empty $HOME directory. Script uses mv command for moving
files. Mv cannot overwrite existing folders (like bin or lib).
```sh
cd
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kare/dotfiles/master/bin/setup-dotfiles > setup-dotfiles
vi setup-dotfiles # Inspect script before running
chmod 755 setup-dotfiles
./setup-dotfiles
rm setup-dotfiles
```
